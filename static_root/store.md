# Drawing Tools

This extension adds four new tools for both drawing and fog:

- A "select cells" tool that outlines selected squares / hexes
- A "lasso" tool that draws around a bunch of squares / hexes outline them all
- A "paint brush" tool that lets you scribble on the map
- A "lock all" button to lock / unlock all drawings.

### Other

- The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidsev/owlbear-drawing-tools)
